Look at the Sea Lion House in East Sussex. Collect images including the floor plans and create a double page on the building and the architect. Make links between the building and the Bauhaus and then look at early modernism in the UK. Collect images and then print in colour when back in the department. This double page follows on from the Bauhause page set.
