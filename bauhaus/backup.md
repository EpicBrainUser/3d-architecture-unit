# Bauhaus de Dessau (timeline)

Designed by __Walter Gropius__ (1883 - 1969)

* Began in 1919 in Weimar, Gropius founded the Bauhaus movement
  
  * This movement aimed to reconcile art and crafts to create a new industrial aesthetic, what we now call design
    
    * This included everything, from metalworking to painting but also performances such as dance and stagecraft. Here furniture was designed as well.

* In 1925, the far right won the elections in Weimar and shut down the school.
  
  * In Dessau, the city council released funds for the construction of the Bauhaus
  * Dessau was an ideal location for the Bauhaus due to its strong industry
  * Land was made available for Gropius in a relatively isolated area, separated from town

* ## Design of the Bauhaus
  
  * ### Sections of the Bauhaus
    
    * #### The Higher Academy for the Arts
      
      * A parallelepiped that houses the large Bauhaus workshops. 
      * Given every opportunity for expansion - with no partitions to give it an impression of enclosure
      * Designed to be the most powerful element of the project - an image that would mark people
    
    * #### Area for the Administrative Department and Director's office
      
      * Center of the building
      * Linking the two schools: the Bauhaus and its workshops and the Technical school
      * Two story construction of the bridge also housing the most prized workshop in the school - the architecture workshop
        * This bridge would be built on stilts - highlighting the fashionable cubist idea of interpenetration of space

    * #### A collective area with a theater and a refractory
      
      * Where the students of the technical school, those of the art school and the teachers could meet 
      * A place of performance, leisure and encounters
    
    * #### Studio accommodation for the students
      
      * This has 24 student flats on four floors - the highest section of the building
      * Rooms extend out onto tiny balconies - that provide the feeling of additional space

    * #### Housing for the teachers
      
      * Self Explanatory

    * #### Technical school to train young apprentices (as requested by the Dessau City Council)
      
      * No glass walls here, these were classrooms so the windows were placed high so as not to distract the students
      * Less prestigious here
  
  * ### Orientation of the Bauhaus
    
    * Gropius had to decide on the orientation of the building, now having drawn out an outline for it 
    * He chose to make it so that the sun in the summer would wake the students, reminding them of their first duty: a harmonious relationship with nature 
    * He would then locate the leading parallelepiped of the main workshop between east and west - making it so that all day long the workshops would be flooded with light. This unintentionally made it a greenhouse due to the glass walls
    * Finally he gave the technical school the final rays of light

* The "Glass Curtain" of the workshop bearing no weight was already partially tested in the 'faggus factory' built with Adolf Meyer

* America was is inspiration from this - industrial design from here, for example:
  
  * The grain silos of Canada and South America
  
  * The coal silos of the huge railway lines
  
  * The most modern workshops of the North American companies
    
    * Here Gropius was free to place them how he liked, and chose for an interlinked structure in a deliberately asymmetric form
    * To truly understand the building and its subsequent parts one must walk around, and walk around to find the discreet entrance - which is against classical architecture where the central door is the most central part of the building 

* ## Construction of the Bauhaus
  
  * It was built in just over a year - very short period as a point needed to be proved
  * Gropius used assembly lines on the worksites - copying Ford's ideas here

* December 4th, 1926, inauguration of the Bauhaus
  
  * Theatrical performances followed over the next two days
  * Thousands of people came to watch this

* At 43, the Architect, Walter Gropius was also its director

* ## Modernism in the BauHaus

    * Here this would mean that: 
        * Useage of simpler shapes in design, elimiation of decorative features
            * So rectangles and spheres are almost entirely the design
        * Rounding off corners for the building, furniture inside the building,
          and walls inside the building are too often rounded off
        * However some are characterised by rectangular features, such as those
          seen in the protruding balconies
        * Perhaps the most important modernist principle of "form
        follows function", where everything is designed purely through
        the lens of how it should be used, ignoring the form of it.

    * ### Materials in Modernism, as seen through the BauHaus

        * Material use in modernism makes use of the idea   
        _"truth to materials"_  
        and  
        _"material honestry"_
