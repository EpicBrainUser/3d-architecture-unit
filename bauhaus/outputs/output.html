<h2 id="vernacular-vs-modernist">Vernacular vs Modernist</h2>
<p>Defintions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Vernacular</strong> -<br />
Vernacular architecture follows regional, local and traditional styles
of architecture. This typically means that fine details are left in for
decoration, in stark contrast to modernist architecture.<br />
Here, the key design principle is following tradition - which means only
the local style. This means a hose in Switzerland will look nothing like
a house in England, as each follows the local style.</p>

<h3 id="vernacular---vietnam">Vernacular - Vietnam</h3>
<ul>
<li>Vietnam has a very different style of vernacular architecture to the
UK, with a large amount of their houses on stils because of the rainy
season, and large sloping roofs for the same reason. The materials are
also very different, relying on hay and mud over bricks and
concrete.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Modernist</strong> -<br />
Modernist architecture is following the modernism movement - from
traditional forms of art towards more abstract forms. Specifically in
architecture, it means to simplify and ‘streamline’ the architecture,
which would remove most decorative details instead choosing to replace
them with straight edges and right angles. The primary design idea is
‘form follows function’ - Louis Sullivan, and predicting and designing
everything around the function, so how it would be used, and then, only
later, if neccessary to add form.</p>

<h2 id="bauhaus-of-dessau-timeline">Bauhaus of Dessau (timeline)</h2>
<p>Designed by <strong>Walter Gropius</strong> (1883 - 1969)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Began in 1919 in Weimar, Gropius founded the Bauhaus movement</p>
<ul>
<li>This movement aimed to reconcile art and crafts to create a new
industrial aesthetic, what we now call design - specifically modernism
<ul>
<li><p>Modernism was crucial to the Bauhaus, and the Bauhaus is built
around it.</p></li>
<li><p>This included everything, from metalworking to painting but also
performances such as dance and stagecraft. Here furniture was designed
as well.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In 1925, the far right won the elections in Weimar and shut down
the school.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Dessau, the city council released funds for the construction of
the Bauhaus</li>
<li>Dessau was an ideal location for the Bauhaus due to its strong
industry</li>
<li>Land was made available for Gropius in a relatively isolated area,
separated from town</li>

<li><h6 id="orientation-of-the-bauhaus">Orientation of the Bauhaus</h6>
<ul>
<li>Gropius had to decide on the orientation of the building, now having
drawn out an outline for it</li>
<li>He chose to make it so that the sun in the summer would wake the
students, reminding them of their first duty: a harmonious relationship
with nature</li>
<li>He would then locate the leading parallelepiped of the main workshop
between east and west - making it so that all day long the workshops
would be flooded with light. This unintentionally made it a greenhouse
due to the glass walls</li>
<li>Finally he gave the technical school the final rays of light</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The “Glass Curtain” of the workshop bearing no weight was already
partially tested in the ‘faggus factory’ built with Adolf Meyer</p>

<li><p>America was is inspiration from this - industrial design from
here, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The grain silos of Canada and South America</p></li>
<li><p>The coal silos of the huge railway lines</p></li>
<li><p>The most modern workshops of the North American companies</p>
<ul>
<li>Here Gropius was free to place them how he liked, and chose for an
interlinked structure in a deliberately asymmetric form</li>
<li>To truly understand the building and its subsequent parts one must
walk around, and walk around to find the discreet entrance - which is
against classical architecture where the central door is the most
central part of the building</li>

Bauhaus</h4>

<ul>
<li>Theatrical performances followed over the next two days</li>

<li><h4 id="modernism-in-the-bauhaus">Modernism in the Bauhaus</h4>
<ul>
<li>Here this would mean that:
<ul>
<li>Useage of simpler shapes in design, elimiation of decorative
features
<ul>
<li>So rectangles and spheres are almost entirely the design</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rounding off corners for the building, furniture inside the
building, and walls inside the building are too often rounded off</li>
<li>However some are characterised by rectangular features, such as
those seen in the protruding balconies</li>
<li>Perhaps the most important modernist principle of “form follows
function”, where everything is designed purely through the lens of how
it should be used, ignoring the form of it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><h6
id="materials-in-modernism-as-seen-through-the-bauhaus">Materials in
Modernism, as seen through the Bauhaus</h6>
<ul>
<li><p>Material use in modernism makes use of the idea<br />
<em>“truth to materials”</em><br />
and<br />
<em>“material honestry”</em><br />
Now what does this mean?<br />
The concept behind it is, that when you use a material, you should for a
reason, and explicitly show that you use that material.<br />
So, if you make a steel pillar, don’t hide that fact you are using
concrete, you shouldn’t paint over it, or try to disguise the fact that
you are using steel, but instead show off that you are using steel by
leaving it bare.<br />
We clearly see this design concept being used when we look at th
bauhaus: We have the glass curtain with aluminium and steel
reinforcements. Just by looking at it we know what material it is -
which is the point</p></li>
<li><p>Concrete examples of materials /* ba dum tsch */</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Bauhaus there were several key materials used:<br />
</li>
<li>Steel - this was a material for <em>power</em>, showing strenth in
the builiding.<br />
</li>
<li>Glass - this was to create a sense of transparency, and letting
light pour into the building</li>
<li>Concrete - this was to create the industrial asthetic and beauty of
raw materials, as well as to create the sense strength, helping the
Steel</li>

both modernist</li>

<li><p>It was located in the UK</p>
