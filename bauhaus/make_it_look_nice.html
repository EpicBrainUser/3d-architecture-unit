<h1>Bauhaus de Dessau (timeline)</h1>
<p>Designed by <strong>Walter Gropius</strong> (1883 - 1969)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Began in 1919 in Weimar, Gropius founded the Bauhaus movement</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This movement aimed to reconcile art and crafts to create a new industrial aesthetic, what we now call design</p>
<ul>
<li>This included everything, from metalworking to painting but also performances such as dance and stagecraft. Here furniture was designed as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In 1925, the far right won the elections in Weimar and shut down the school.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Dessau, the city council released funds for the construction of the Bauhaus</li>
<li>Dessau was an ideal location for the Bauhaus due to its strong industry</li>
<li>Land was made available for Gropius in a relatively isolated area, separated from town</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h2>Design of the Bauhaus</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Sections of the Bauhaus</h3>
<ul>
<li><h4>The Higher Academy for the Arts</h4>
<ul>
<li>A parallelepiped that houses the large Bauhaus workshops.</li>
<li>Given every opportunity for expansion - with no partitions to give it an impression of enclosure</li>
<li>Designed to be the most powerful element of the project - an image that would mark people</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h4>Area for the Administrative Department and Director's office</h4>
<ul>
<li>Center of the building</li>
<li>Linking the two schools: the Bauhaus and its workshops and the Technical school</li>
<li>Two story construction of the bridge also housing the most prized workshop in the school - the architecture workshop<ul>
<li>This bridge would be built on stilts - highlighting the fashionable cubist idea of interpenetration of space</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h4>A collective area with a theater and a refractory</h4>
<ul>
<li>Where the students of the technical school, those of the art school and the teachers could meet</li>
<li>A place of performance, leisure and encounters</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h4>Studio accommodation for the students</h4>
<ul>
<li>This has 24 student flats on four floors - the highest section of the building</li>
<li>Rooms extend out onto tiny balconies - that provide the feeling of additional space</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h4>Housing for the teachers</h4>
</li>
<li><h4>Technical school to train young apprentices (as requested by the Dessau City Council)</h4>
<ul>
<li>No glass walls here, these were classrooms so the windows were placed high so as not to distract the students</li>
<li>Less prestigious here</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3>Orientation of the Bauhaus</h3>
</li>
<li><p>Gropius had to decide on the orientation of the building, now having drawn out an outline for it</p>
</li>
<li><p>He chose to make it so that the sun in the summer would wake the students, reminding them of their first duty: a harmonious relationship with nature (side note: Mr. Murray said this was &quot;This is like the most <em>German</em> thing ever&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li><p>He would then locate the leading parallelepiped of the main workshop between east and west - making it so that all day long the workshops would be flooded with light. This unintentionally made it a greenhouse due to the glass walls</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally he gave the technical school the final rays of light</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The &quot;Glass Curtain&quot; of the workshop bearing no weight was already partially tested in the 'faggus factory' built with Adolf Meyer</p>
</li>
<li><p>America was is inspiration from this - industrial design from here, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The grain silos of Canada and South America</p>
</li>
<li><p>The coal silos of the huge railway lines</p>
</li>
<li><p>The most modern workshops of the North American companies</p>
<ul>
<li>Here Gropius was free to place them how he liked, and chose for an interlinked structure in a deliberately asymmetric form</li>
<li>To truly understand the building and its subsequent parts one must walk around, and walk around to find the discreet entrance - which is against classical architecture where the central door is the most central part of the building</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h2>Construction of the Bauhaus</h2>
<ul>
<li>It was built in just over a year - very short period as a point needed to be proved</li>
<li>Gropius used assembly lines on the worksites - copying Ford's ideas here</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>December 4th, 1926, inauguration of the Bauhaus</p>
<ul>
<li>Theatrical performances followed over the next two days</li>
<li>Thousands of people came to watch this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>At 43, the Architect, Walter Gropius was also its director</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
